# Hello! 

My name is bella, and I've been a developer for around 8 years now. I started my journey with C and a couple months later, used unity for the first time. since then, I've worked on **many** projects that I'm suuper proud of, including things like a full 2D game engine, and currently working on a couple retro games.

I also consider myself to be fox-like, so don't be afraid to call me a fox!
You can find my Itch.io page here https://deep-forest-interactive.itch.io
I also have a youtube channel(I'm not that active on it, but I plan to be more active in the future): https://youtube.com/@apianbelle1343

I appreciate you checking me out, and if you want my help with any projects, you can contact me on discord: Bella Marie#3381
